# CorruptedMC Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/41e783b5-a0f2-4ebd-afb1-1e804ec8181f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/corruptedmc/deploys)

This is the main website for CorruptedMC, a Minecraft server.
I'd like to keep it simple since the number of active users is small.
I'm using Netlify to deploy and manage the SSL certificate for the website.
